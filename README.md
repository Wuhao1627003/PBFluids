# PBFluids
Maya plugin for PB Fluids

*PBFluidsGL*: A naive test of basic algorithm rendered with OpenGL. It uses the same data structure as our final product, but does not permit user control, and lack advanced features such as custom containers, mesh decomposition etc.

*PBFluids*: Complete maya plugin for decomposing custom 3D mesh into particles, and simulate its interaction with custom container, allowing full control of parameters.
